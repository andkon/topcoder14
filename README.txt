Welcome to Chainlock - the bitcoin wallet that's secured by your own unique heartbeat.

Because we used the Nymi API, testing our incredible nymi bitcoin wallet may be tricky!

We recommend testing it using iOS simulator and the Nymulator, which is a part of their SDK, downloadable here:

Best directions:
1. Build and launch the iOS app in the iPhone 6 simulator.
2. Open up the Nymulator. Create a virtual nymi using the + icon on the left side of the screen.
3. In the simulator, tap on the "Sign in with Nymi" button.
4. In the Nymulator, tap 'Provision'.
5. When prompted, press on 'connect andrew's nymi'
6. You're in! Have fun.
